# README
## Purpose of this "Web Application"
This project aims to provide a visual dashboard for relationships with other teams within an organization. It can show how you feel your relationship with their team is as a combination of your relationship with each respective sub-team. You can also enter a trend indicator to show how your relationship is changing at the moment, and a description for further explanation for each sub-team.
## Usage
### How to use
The data in **data.json** is sample data to demonstrate the functionality of this dashboard. In order to change it to fit your own needs, you will need to alter **data.json** using the same structure currently in use.
### Files
There are various files that are part of this project. Here is an overview of what each one does:
- **index.html**: This is the file that your web browser uses to actually render the dashboard. It contains the html as well as the javascript to look at the data.
- **data.json**: This is where you enter the data about the various teams and sub-teams. As a user of this program, this is where you should be spending most/all of your time.
- **bootstrap.bundle.min.js**: Part of the bootstrap framework used to create the dashboard. Learn more [here](https://getbootstrap.com/).
- **bootstrap.min.css**: Part of the bootstrap framework used to create the dashboard. Learn more [here](https://getbootstrap.com/).
- **custom-style.css**: Custom styles to override some of the bootstrap framework to customize the dashboard to fit NBCUniversal's style.
